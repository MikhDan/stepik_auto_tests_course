Part 3. Test frameworks

That night in Manhattan was the start of it
We lived it and we loved every part of it
The glow of moonlight in the park
The lights that spell your name
The autumn breeze that fanned the spark
That set our hearts aflame

Our kiss was a sky-ride to the highest star
We made it without touching a handlebar
And I gave you my love
To the melody of the music, the madness
That made our Manhattan serenade
